# leaflet-challenge

Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a map-based visualization that displays earthquake data provided by USGS. The tool will allow users to:

	•	View earthquake locations on an interactive map.
	•	See earthquake magnitude, depth, and location details via map markers and popups.
	•	Explore different map styles and overlays (e.g., tectonic plates, terrain).
	•	Enhance understanding of earthquake distribution and characteristics.

Features

	1.	Interactive Map Layers:
	•	Default Map: Displays earthquake data with an option to switch between different map layers (e.g., topography, gray-scale, water color).
	•	Tectonic Plates Overlay: Visualizes the boundaries of tectonic plates on the map.
	•	Earthquake Data: Circle markers represent earthquake locations, color-coded by depth and sized by magnitude.
	2.	Dynamic Popups:
	•	Each earthquake marker includes a popup with the following information:
	•	Magnitude
	•	Depth
	•	Location
	3.	Legend:
	•	Displays the range of earthquake depths, with color coding for easy interpretation.
	4.	Real-time Data:
	•	Earthquake data is fetched dynamically from the USGS’s live API, ensuring that the latest information is always shown.
